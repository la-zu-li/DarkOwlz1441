## About me
My name is Isaac. I study Software Engineering at Federal University of Cear√°, Brazil, since 2020.

I myself am brazillian, and I plan to do a PhD and Masters on Computer Science in the future. My areas of interest are Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I like programming little projects as a hobby.

## Technologies I am familiar with
I'm familiar with:

- C and Python languages.

- Flex and GNU Bison as compiler generators.

- Windows and Linux environments (even though I prefer Linux for personal use).

- Basic concepts of computer vision

- Basic machine learning algorithms and concepts and algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.

- Databases and relational databases concepts and modeling, and SQL. I made small projects with PostgreSQL in the past.
